Sun|Sol
Use this domain for words related to the sun. The sun does three basic things. It moves, it gives light, and it gives heat. These three actions are involved in the meanings of most of the words in this domain. Since the sun moves below the horizon, many words refer to it setting or rising. Since the sun is above the clouds, many words refer to it moving behind the clouds and the clouds blocking its light. The sun's light and heat also produce secondary effects. The sun causes plants to grow, and it causes damage to things.|Hac uti verba ad solem. Tria sunt praecipua solis. Movet, illuminat et calefacit. Haec tria verba involvunt in hac potissimum rationibus. Movet cum sol sub horizonte ortu occasu aut multa refert. Cum sole interdum supra nubes uolitare multis obsistentibus ad lumen et nubes post nubes movebat. Secundarium effectus producere calor et lux solis. Sol facit crescere plantas et ad damnum.
