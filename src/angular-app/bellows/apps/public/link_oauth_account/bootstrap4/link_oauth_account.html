        Hi, {{ oauth_full_name_for_login }}. You've signed in with your {{ oauth_email_for_login }}
        Google account, but we don't have that address associated with a Scripture Forge account. Do
        you already have a Scripture Forge account? Then click "Link existing account" and sign in to
        your Scripture Forge account, and we will link it to your Google account so that you can log
        in faster next time. If you don't already have a Scripture Forge account, click "Create new
        account" and we will create a new account for you, already linked to your Google account.
