 * This strategy syncs the memory cache with a persistent backup. A normal sync strategy cannot be used, because it
 * passes along the transform that the cache receives in its sync call. This transform does not include the removal of
 * dependent records. In order to deal with this side-effect, this strategy collects all remove operations executed on
 * the cache by listening to the "patch" event, and then creating a new transform that includes the extra remove
 * operations.
